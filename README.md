# Robots Bringup (Documentation)

This repository contains instructions and other documents related to my "*articubot_one*" project, which originated from Articulated Robotics code:

https://github.com/slgrobotics/articubot_one

It is intended to run navigation on my Turtlebot-like robots - in Gazebo simulation or with physical robots, indoors or outdoors.

Some of the docs here deal with Desktop ("*Ground Station*") setup and operation, while others describe setup of on-board Raspberry Pi computers.

We assume:

- On the Desktop machine (Intel, AMD) - Ubuntu 24.04 64-bit *desktop*, ROS Jazzy

- On-board single board computer (SBC) - Raspberry Pi 5 8GB or similar, Ubuntu *server* 24.04 64-bit, ROS Jazzy

If you just want to run a simulation in Gazebo, or need to set up your Desktop with ROS Jazzy -

see https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/ROS-Jazzy (no robot hardware required).

## Dragger

The outdoorsy robot Dragger (Raspberry 5, GPS) is described here:

## Plucky

An indoors mapper robot Plucky is described here (Raspberry 5):

## Create 1 Turtlebot

Classic Turtlebot, a visitor from the ancient times, running on Raspberry 3B, now Jazzified:
