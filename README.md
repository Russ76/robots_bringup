# Robots Bringup - Plucky

This is my *robots_bringup* ROS2 package, derived from Turtlebot3 Navigation and some Articulate Robotics code.

It is intended to run navigation on my Tutrtlebot-like robots, starting with Plucky

Plucky is a *"larger Turtlebot"* - running, basically, standard ROS2 Turtlebot 3 binaries for navigation (on the desktop "ground station" computer). Onboard it has two Raspberry Pi 3B and an "FPV Drone" TV camera. One RPi runs sensors drivers (LD14 LIDAR and MPU9250), the other - Differential Drive Control, inspired by Articulated Robotics (https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/mobile-robot-full-list/).
