## Make Your Own Robot

This section describes hardware components which can be used to make a robot very similar to my Plucky and Dragger.

Turtle (Create 1 robot) is a bit different, and could be replicated verbatim, if you have an iRobot Create 1 base.

Once you've put together all recommended hardware, my software should work without much change. It should work with very little change on almost any hardware, once you figured out how to move the wheels with cmd_vel topic and deliver wheel encoder ticks to be published by joint broadcaster.
