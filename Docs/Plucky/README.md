Plucky is a *"larger Turtlebot"* - running, basically, standard ROS2 Turtlebot 3 binaries for navigation (on the desktop "ground station" computer). Onboard it has two Raspberry Pi 3B and an "FPV Drone" TV camera. One RPi runs sensors drivers (LD14 LIDAR and MPU9250), the other - Differential Drive Control, inspired by Articulated Robotics (https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/mobile-robot-full-list/).
