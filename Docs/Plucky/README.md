Plucky is a *"larger Turtlebot"* - running, basically, standard ROS2 Turtlebot 3 binaries for navigation (on the desktop "ground station" computer). Onboard it has two Raspberry Pi 3B ("plucky" and "pluckysens") and an "FPV Drone" TV camera. One RPi runs sensors drivers (LD14 LIDAR and MPU9250), the other - Differential Drive Control, inspired by Articulated Robotics.

## Build and Run Instructions:

Plucky has several Arduino boards, some drive sensors - GPS, Ultrasonic Parking Sensor, MPU, - while the main Arduino Mega 2560 drives the wheels and combines all sensors data into a single serial stream for Raspberry Pi "plucky". This setup appeared historically through different experiments and at this time is mostly just an over-enginered legacy. "pluckysens" RPi has its own MPU9250, and GPS isn't useful indoors. But "plucky" RPi makes full use of wheels driving ability and odometry info. Parking sensors data will be likely used later, as ROS2 supports rangers for obstacle avoidance and mapping.

FPV Camera and receiver Setup [optional]:

The receiver above, when plugged into a Ubuntu 22.04 **Desktop USB port**, shows up as _/dev/video0_ and _video1_

It works with Cheese app and can be read by Python/OpenCV scripts, including custom ROS nodes written in Python.

Here is the code I use for the camera **on the Desktop side**: https://github.com/slgrobotics/camera_publisher

### "pluckysens" Raspberry Pi 3B setup (ROS2 LD14 LIDAR and MPU9250 Drivers):

```
mkdir -p ~/plucky_ws/src
cd ~/plucky_ws/src
// LiDAR LD14 (on /dev/ttyUSB0):
git clone  https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git

vi ~/plucky_ws/src/ros2_mpu9250_driver/src/mpu9250driver.cpp   - line 48:   message.header.frame_id = "imu_link"; (was "base_link")

cd ~/plucky_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build

### Note: Plucky Arduino Mega 2560 should be on /dev/ttyACM0
```

### "plucky" Raspberry Pi 3B setup (ROS2 Differential Drive Control):

See https://github.com/slgrobotics/diffdrive_arduino (inspired by Articulated Robotics)

Prerequisites:
```
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers
```
Now, to the business:

```
mkdir -p ~/plucky_ws/src
cd ~/plucky_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/slgrobotics/diffdrive_arduino.git
git clone https://github.com/joshnewans/serial.git
git clone https://github.com/slgrobotics/articubot_one.git

cd ~/plucky_ws
### Note: See https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Rosdep.html
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
### Note: build takes ~10 minutes
colcon build

### Note: Plucky Arduino Mega 2560 on /dev/ttyACM0
```
