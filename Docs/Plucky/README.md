Plucky is a *"larger Turtlebot"* - running, basically, standard ROS2 Turtlebot 3 binaries for navigation (on the desktop "ground station" computer). Onboard it has two Raspberry Pi 3B ("plucky" and "pluckysens") and an "FPV Drone" TV camera. One RPi runs sensors drivers (LD14 LIDAR and MPU9250), the other - Differential Drive Control, inspired by Articulated Robotics.

## Build and Run Instructions:

Plucky has several Arduino boards, some drive sensors - GPS, Ultrasonic Parking Sensor, MPU, - while the main Arduino Mega 2560 drives the wheels and combines all sensors data into a single serial stream for Raspberry Pi "plucky". This setup appeared historically through different experiments and at this time is mostly just an over-enginered legacy. "pluckysens" RPi has its own MPU9250, and GPS isn't useful indoors. But "plucky" RPi makes full use of wheels driving ability and odometry info. Parking sensors data will be likely used later, as ROS2 supports rangers for obstacle avoidance and mapping.
