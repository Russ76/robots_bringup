### _Optional:_ Create a Linux service for on-boot autostart

**Note:** This guide is written for _Create 1 Turtlebot_, but it applies to any other robot with minor changes.

See 

With Create base, XV11 Laser Scanner and BNO055 IMU ROS2 nodes tested, it is time to set up autostart on boot for hands-free operation.

We need some files (copy them from this repository, under and around https://github.com/slgrobotics/turtlebot_create/tree/main/RPi_Setup/launch):

1. Create and populate launch folder: /home/ros/launch
```
mkdir ~/launch
cd ~/launch
# place myturtle.py and bootup_launch.sh here:
cp ~/robot_ws/src/create_robot/create_bringup/launch/bootup_launch.sh .
cp ~/robot_ws/src/create_robot/create_bringup/launch/myturtle.py .
chmod +x ~/launch/bootup_launch.sh    
```
Try running the _bootup_launch.sh_ from the command line to see if anything fails.

2. Create service description file (as _"sudo"_) - _/etc/systemd/system/robot.service_ :
```
# /etc/systemd/system/robot.service
[Unit]
Description=turtle
StartLimitIntervalSec=60
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ros
Group=ros
WorkingDirectory=/home/ros/launch
ExecStart=/home/ros/launch/bootup_launch.sh
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable robot.service
sudo systemctl start robot.service
```
If all went well, the service will start automatically after you reboot the RPi, and all related nodes will show up on _rpt_ and _rpt_graph_

**Note:** 
1. Logs are stored in _/home/ros/.ros/log_ folder - these can grow if things go wrong.
2. Raspberry Pi 3B is adequate for the _"headless"_ Turtlebot (except for the 14+ hours compilation) - it runs at <30% CPU load and low memory consumption.

Here are some useful commands:
```
systemctl status robot.service
systemctl cat robot.service
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart robot.service
sudo journalctl -xeu robot.service

sudo ls -al /etc/systemd/system/robot.service
sudo ls -al /etc/systemd/system/robot.service.d/override.conf
sudo ls -al /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/robot.service
ps -ef | grep driver
```
You can now reboot Raspberry Pi, and the three drivers will start automatically and show up in **rqt** and **rqt_graph** on the Desktop
