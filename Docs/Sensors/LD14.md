# LD14 LIDAR setup

Original code: https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_sl_ros2    (Google Translate works here)

We will be using my fork https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git with minor corrections.

**Note:** Original code delivers various beam counts (378...393) between messages, and ROS (i.e. SLAM Toolbox) doesn't tolerate this.
So, I added code to ensure that the number of points in a scan is constant between LIDAR head revolutions.

LiDAR LD14 should appear on /dev/ttyUSB0

```
mkdir -p ~/robot_ws/src
cd ~/robot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git
```
Make sure you completes the "USB.md" guide to make device handles persistent.
