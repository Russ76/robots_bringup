## LD14 LIDAR setup

### Positioning on the robot

On my robots LD14 LIDAR is placed so that the motor faces forward:

### Connecting your LD14

I am using FTDI or similar TTL->USB adapter and plug it in USB port of Raspberry PI. Optional direct 5V power can be used.  

LiDAR LD14 should appear on /dev/ttyUSB0 or similar on your Raspberry Pi

Refer to the "PersistentUSB.md" guide to make device handles persistent:

### ROS2 Driver Code

Original code: https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_sl_ros2    (Google Translate works here)

We will be using my fork https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git with minor corrections.

**Note:** Original code delivers various beam counts (378...393) between messages, and ROS (i.e. SLAM Toolbox) doesn't tolerate this.
So, I added code to ensure that the number of points in a scan is constant between LIDAR head revolutions.

```
mkdir -p ~/robot_ws/src
cd ~/robot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git
```
