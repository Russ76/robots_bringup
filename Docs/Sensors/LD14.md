## LD14 and STL-19P LIDAR setup

### Positioning on the robot

On my Plucky robot LD14 LIDAR is placed so that the motor faces forward:

The STL-19P LIDAR has an arrow on top whicn should be facing forward. Here is how it is placed on Dragger:

### Connecting your LD14 / STL-19P

For LD14 I am using FTDI or similar TTL->USB adapter and plug it in USB port of Raspberry PI. Optional direct 5V power can be used.

STL-19P "kit" comes with an interface board, which has micro-USB socket. Just use USB cable to connect it to Raspberry Pi. 

LiDAR should appear on /dev/ttyUSB0 or similar on your Raspberry Pi

Refer to the "PersistentUSB.md" guide to make device handles persistent:

### ROS2 Driver Code

Original code: https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_sl_ros2    (Google Translate works here)

We will be using my fork https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git with minor corrections.

**Note:** Original code delivers various beam counts (378...393) between messages, and ROS (i.e. SLAM Toolbox) doesn't tolerate this.
So, I added code to ensure that the number of points in a scan is constant between LIDAR head revolutions.

```
mkdir -p ~/robot_ws/src
cd ~/robot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/slgrobotics/ldlidar_sl_ros2.git
```
**Note:** STL-19P (LD19P) LIDAR has 230400 baud rate and ```'product_name': 'LDLiDAR_LD14P'``` setting works for it.
